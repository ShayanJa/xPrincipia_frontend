                <p class="solutionSummary"> This model is derived from Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff's Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch OR) theory. The brain uses quantum computation due to trypophan pi bonds in neuron microtubules. This avoids a problem based on Godel's Incompleteness Theorem and allows more complex computation. Studying similar quantum actions in the brain and the effects of tryptophan analogs on consciousness could provide further information.</p>
